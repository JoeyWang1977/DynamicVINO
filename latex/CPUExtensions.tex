\subsection*{Introducing C\+PU Extensions}

The C\+PU extensions library contains code of important layers that do not come with the C\+PU plugin. You should compile this library and use the {\ttfamily Add\+Extension} method in your application to load the extensions when for models featuring layers from this library. Refer to other samples for {\ttfamily Add\+Extension} code examples.

When you compile the entire list of the samples, this library (it\textquotesingle{}s target name is \char`\"{}cpu\+\_\+extension)\char`\"{} is compiled automatically.

For performance reasons, the library\textquotesingle{}s cmake script automatically detects configuration of your machine and enables optimizations for your platform. Alternatively, you can explicitly use special cmake flags\+: {\ttfamily -\/\+D\+E\+N\+A\+B\+L\+E\+\_\+\+A\+V\+X2=ON}, {\ttfamily -\/\+D\+E\+N\+A\+B\+L\+E\+\_\+\+A\+V\+X512F=ON} or {\ttfamily -\/\+D\+E\+N\+A\+B\+L\+E\+\_\+\+S\+S\+E42=ON} when cross-\/compiling this library for another platform.
